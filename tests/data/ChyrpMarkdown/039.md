Paragraph text with a footnote reference.[^1]

[^1]:
    Footnotes can span multiple lines.
    A blank line will end the footnote definition
    unless the next line is indented by 4 spaces or 1 tab.

    This rule allows footnotes to contain multiple paragraphs.

This text is not part of the footnote.
