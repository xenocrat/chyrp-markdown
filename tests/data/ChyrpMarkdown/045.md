This is a footnote reference[^1].

[^1]: Footnote text can optionally be indented
      up to the same width as the footnote marker.
      The indentation will be removed, which means
      code blocks in the footnote must be indented
      by the marker's width plus 4 spaces or 1 tab.
Therefore:

          this is a code block
        but this is not.
